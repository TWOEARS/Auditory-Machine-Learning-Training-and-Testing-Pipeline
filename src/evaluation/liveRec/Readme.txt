This is a script + set of tools for evluating identification models from pre-recorded session on a robot.
Pre-recorded sessions may include single sounds as well as mixtures emitted from multiple speakers.

The sound data is injected directly into the blackboard system via the JidoRecInterface class.

By default it will look for the models that come with the identification example inside the twoears/examples repository
